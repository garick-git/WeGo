#### Repo Description <br>

The supply-backend repository contains our the code for the supply backend. This include the App.py file as well as our our VehicleAPI/vehicle heartbeat.<br> 
Within the models folder, we have our each of our objects alongside their getters and setters. Also in the models folder we have our enums folder, which contains all enumerations for the repo.    <br>

#### Testing  <br>
In the Unit Testing folder we have a different test for each section of the code. Each unit test is labeled in relation to what it is testing. The unit testing we are expected to conduct can be done by using a variety of testing frameworks depending on what you are testing.

To test code follow these steps:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Log in to the supply server droplet<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Navigate to the tests directory in the supply-backend repo<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. cd /home/team22/repos/supply-backend/src/tests/<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Run the test<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. python3 -m testNameHere<br>

#### Contribution Guidelines <br>

When contributing to the repo we want to make sure we are taking the right steps. This consists of using pull requests, documentation and doing frequent merging to avoid any conflicts. This can happen when two teammates modify the same lines in a file and each merges to the master branch.  <br>
How do you solve this? Either change the modification on the spot while in the master branch or choose between either developers change. Along with that we need to use branching instead of solely merging into the mast branch. Having a variety of branches for different sectors of our code allows for better collaboration and improvement on code quality  <br>

#### Connections  <br>


To clone a Bitbucket repository onto your local machine, follow these steps: <br>

1. Open a terminal on your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
3. Get the HTTPS URL for the repository you want to clone. You can find this by     navigating to the repository on Bitbucket and clicking the "Clone" button. Select "HTTPS" and copy the URL.
4. In the terminal enter the following command, replacing [repository URL] with the HTTPS URL you copied:  git clone [repository URL]
5. Press Enter to execute the command. Git will download the repository files to your local machine in a new directory with the same name as the repository.
<br>
Once the cloning process is complete, you can start working with the repository on your local machine. If you make changes to the files, you can use Git to push those changes back to the Bitbucket repository.

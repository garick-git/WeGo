#### Testing  <br>

In the Unit Testing folder we have a different test for each section of the code. Each unit test is labeled in relation to what it is testing. The unit testing we are expected to conduct can be done by using a variety of testing frameworks depending on what you are testing.  <br>
For example if you are testing code from our App.py you may want to use unittest or pytest, as for testing the coverage metric, you can use coverage.py which can be installed into your local computer, information/guidelines for this can be found in the QA google drive folder.  <br>


#### Contribution guidelines <br>

When contributing to the repo we want to make sure we are taking the right steps. This consists of using pull requests, documentation and doing frequent merging to avoid any conflicts. This can happen when two teammates modify the same lines in a file and each merges to the master branch.  <br>
How do you solve this? Either change the modification on the spot while in the master branch or choose between either developers change. Along with that we need to use branching instead of solely merging into the mast branch. Having a variety of branches for different sectors of our code allows for better collaboration and improvement on code quality  <br>
